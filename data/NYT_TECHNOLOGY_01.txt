Brad Inman wants to bring books into the 21st century. His year-old start-up, Vook (which we’ve written about here and here), mashes and mixes videos and photos with text to create multimedia books for devices like the iPhone and, soon, the iPad.

Now Vook is set to expand, announcing that it has raised $2.5 million in seed funding from a group of prominent Silicon Valley and New York investors including Ron Conway, Michael Maples and Kenneth Lerer, chairman of The Huffington Post.

Though Vook has attracted some high-profile attention, agreeing to create multimedia books for authors like Anne Rice and Seth Godin, it has primarily focused on works in the public domain,  like “Grimm’s Fairy Tales,” Sherlock Holmes stories and “Treasure Island,” in an effort to generate interest in the new format. The books are sold in Apple’s App Store for up to $7.

Mr. Inman said he would use the new funding to expand the company and forge new relationships with authors and publishers, and to build automated tools that can generate hundreds of Vooks a week.

“There are infinite possibilities bringing together authors with filmmakers, photographers and all the other creators of media,” Mr. Inman said. “New devices such as smartphones and tablets are creating a huge surge in creativity.”
